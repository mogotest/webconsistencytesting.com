            <h2>Logically</h2>
            <p>
              In Web Consistency Testing we mimic the way many devs approach web development.  We work with a canonical representation
              of a page and then use that as the pivot point for all other comparisons.  Following this process, we have the notion of
              a reference page, which is the canonical representation of a page at any point in time.  Any pages compared against it are
              aptly called comparison pages.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Formally</h2>
            <p>
              Web Consistency Testing is basically a function of the form:

              <pre style="width: 75%;"><em>f</em>(<em>reference_page</em>, <em>comparison_page</em>) &rArr; { rendering issues }</pre>

              NB: the result of this function is a set of rendering issues, not rendering differences.  It's quite possible to have differences
              between two page representations that simply aren't issues.
            </p>

            <h2>Representing a Page</h2>
            <p>
              The two most natural representations of page are as an image or as a serialized DOM.  There is a logical equivalence between the two,
              as the image is the materialization of the DOM.  However, there are big differences in how we can operate with the representations.
              For our purposes the serialized DOM is the preferable representation because of the following reasons:
              
              <ul>
                <li>It's easy to capture with JavaScript.</li>
                <li>Its tree structure is easy to traverse and annotate.</li>
                <li>Most elements are just rectangles in a 3D space, which makes them very easy to work with.</li>
                <li>Any issue we detect has rich semantic meaning &mdash; we can yield a CSS or XPath selector for the element in error.</li>
              </ul>

              In the serialized DOM we represent each element and some key attributes about that element.  E.g., the element's position, its dimensions,
              its opacity, and other attributes that could impact its visual representation on a page.
            </p>

            <h2>Comparing Pages</h2>
            <p>
              Generally we compare pages by doing a depth-first search through the two DOMs, performing a pairwise comparison of elements.  Unfortunately
              there are some complications that must be addressed.  We must strip out any elements that have no rendering counterpart (e.g., the SCRIPT tag).
              We may need to normalize properties (e.g., older versions of IE use a filtering mechanism for opacity).  And we need to augment our
              traversal with some heuristics.  Notably, it's possible that the DOMs do not have a 1:1 mapping of elements, so our comparisons must be
              fuzzy.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              We can do a pretty good job handling the DOM incongruities by applying the same specificity algorithm CSS uses for scoring rules.  While there
              may be cases of ambiguity, I've run this procedure over 500,000 pages and have come across maybe two cases.  And in both situations the DOM
              differences were a result of completely invalid HTML where the browsers were left to their own devices as to how to proceed.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              There are various other heuristics we should employ to improve quality of results.  For example, we shouldn't care where an element appears
              on a page if it's not visible.  Visibility here means how a user perceives the page, not the CSS visibility attribute.  So, elements with
              a "display: none;" value and all their descendants, elements with "visibility: hidden;", elements with no height and/or no width, elements
              positioned outside the boundaries of the page, and elements completely occluded in the Z-plane should all be ignored.
            </p>

            <p>
              Additionally, we should augment our search with skew values.  Whenever a comparison exceeds our current tolerance threshold value we should normalize
              the error dimension when descending to the children.  This allows us to see if the descendants are correct relative to the improperly
              positioned parent.  While such elements may exceed the tolerance threshold when performing a na√Øve comparison, we want to ascertain what
              the root issues in a page are.  Rendering issues tend to have cascading consequences and it's simply not helpful in the debugging process to
              be alerted to a bunch of issues that would immediately be resolved by fixing a problem further up the chain.
            </p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
              Results should always have semantic meaning to them.  Older automated comparison approaches relied on image comparison algorithms.  While this
              was certainly better than nothing, alerting a developer to a region of pixels in error would still require a mental translation to the
              underlying DOM.  Since we're comparing DOM elements, we know where in a document an error occurs.  By reporting the element in the form of
              a CSS or XPath selector and providing extra context about the error detected, we reduce the cognitive load for a developer to fix the problem.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Not only should the results have semantic meaning, but they should be rendering issues and not differences.  A difference could be an
              inconsequential change between the two pages. Or more likely, it's a difference caused by a legitimate problem elsewhere on the page.
              E.g., a DIV that is off by 200px will almost certainly cause other elements on the page to be out of position.  We don't report these
              other elements as rendering issues because they'll be "fixed" by virtue of fixing the positioning issue with the DIV.
            </p>
